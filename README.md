# Marjoree's Portfolio

Welcome! Since the pandemic started, my goal was to build build build. The best place to not only showcase my skills but show my design capabilities as well.

## Intro

Through inmotionhosting and cPanel, I've launched my personal portfolio. Primarily using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ES6, and libraries such as jQuery in the structure of the site.

## Frameworks Used

I initially started with Bootstrap 5 and decided to start from scratch and implement components all on my own.
